Codez is a library designed to help ease the process of generating codes for your end users that can be helpful for confirmation numbers, reservation systems, error codes, and more.

## Getting Started

> dotnet add package Codez

## CodeGenerator

The core of the library is the `CodeGenerator` class, which has two methods: `GenerateAsync` and `TryGenerateAsync`. The `CodeGenerator` class is made up of several dependencies that can change the behavior of the generate methods:

- Alphabet (`IAlphabet`)
- Randomizer (`IRandomizer`)
- Uniqueness (`IUniqueness`)
- Stop Words (`IStopWords`)
- Options (`CodeGeneratorOptions`)

Each dependency is explained in detail below. Codez also comes with some defaults out of the box if you don't want to customize anything.

### GenerateAsync

The `GenerateAsync` method returns a code based on the alphabet and the length specified.

```c#
var generator = new CodeGenerator();
// returns "]hG/g"
string result = await generator.GenerateAsync(length: 5);
```

If the generator fails to generate a code, it will throw a `CodeGeneratorException`.

### TryGenerateAsync

The `TryGenerateAsync` method returns a `CodeGeneratorResult` that gives you the generated value, and some other metadata from the generation process. This method will **not** throw a `CodeGeneratorException`.

```c#
var generator = new CodeGenerator();
// returns CodeGeneratorResult
var result = await generator.TryGenerateAsync(length: 5);

if (result.Success) {
    Console.WriteLine(result.Value);
}
```

### Alphabet

The alphabet is an important part of the generation process. You can constrain what kinds of codes get generated by specifying the alphabet appropriately. Codez comes with an `AsciiAlphabet` by default with characters between `! (33)` and `~ (126)` included.

You can also use the `StringAlphabet` class to pass in a string, and each character will be treated as an option during the generation.

```c#
var alphabet = new StringAlphabet("ABCDE");
var characters = alphabet.Characters;
```

You may also implement your own class using the `IAlphabet` interface.

### Randomizer

The `IRandomizer` interface picks a random index based on your alphabet size. The `RandomRandomizer` is used by default.

### Uniqueness

The `IUniqueness` interface allows you to enforce global uniquness on the codes that are being generated. This can be against a database, web api, or whatever you would like. By default, Codez provides a `NoUniqueness` implementation.

### Stop Words

StopWords (`IStopWords`) provides a mechanism to filter out codes that may be deemed inappropriate or incorrect. You can live on the edge by using the default `NoStopWords`. If you like it boring, you can also use the `InMemoryStopWords` implementation and provide inappropriate words there, which uses and `IndexOf` implementation to find matches.

### Transformers

The transformer (`ITransfomer`) interface allows you to take a uniquely generated code and transform it into something else. The transfomer will only run when the result is a `Success`. **Note, The uniqueness of the code coming from a transfomer is not garaunteed.**

There is a sample in which this libary is used to [generate unique container names](https://github.com/khalidabuhakmeh/codez/blob/master/test/Tests/TransformerTests.cs).

### Options

Options allow you to alter the behavior of the code generation:

- Retry Limit (default of 5): Number of iterations to attempt generation
